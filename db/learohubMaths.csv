"mam i regret but would like to inform you that you were wrong about one thing, that is about the concept of finite and infinite sets, where you took an example of number of rats living in the country and concluded that it is an infinite set but its wrong, the number of rats living in the country is not countable but is some finite number.a similar example is given in the cbse textbook,1.4 finite and infinite setslet a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, b = {a, b, c, d, e, g}and c = { men living presently in different parts of the world}we observe that a contains 5 elements and b contains 6 elements. how many elementsdoes c contain? as it is, we do not know the number of elements in c, but it is somenatural number which may be quite a big number. by number of elements of a set s,we mean the number of distinct elements of the set and we denote it by n (s). if n (s)is a natural number, then s is non-empty finite set.consider the set of natural numbers. we see that the number of elements of thisset is not finite since there are infinite number of natural numbers. we say that the setof natural numbers is an infinite set. the sets a, b and c given above are finite setsand n(a) = 5, n(b) = 6 and n(c) = some finite number.i just wrote what is given in the textbook, i am open to any corrections and errors in my argument.thank you",D

best teacher ever,F
ma'am in the last question ...if we think logically...12 teacher teach maths...and 4 teacher teach both physics and maths ..and remaining which is 4 teacher teaches physics...so the total teacher who teach physics are 4+4 = 8 teachers...and remaining are 12 which teaches maths...so how came 12 physics teachers?? cozz 12 +12=24 teachers,D

link to open ho hi nahi raha hai,D
jo bhi bacche inhe apne school me as a teacher's expact kar rhe he. bhool jao sabka nature school me jakar aap sabke current teachers jesa hi ho jayega jo yaha aapko acche lag rhe he aapke school me akar after some time ye bhi rude ho jayenge kyunki itna patience aajtak kisi teacher me nhi he ki class ke 1 student jo padhna chahta he but samjhne me kaafi time lagata he usse tab tak samjhaye jab tak usse samajh na aye. bs kehne ke hote he jitni marji time pichlo bta denge. but reality ye hoti he= kisi or bacche se puchlo jisko samajh me aya he. ya nalayak tu kabhi nhi padhega. or ignored by jinko samajh me ata he. to tum jhak maarne a rhe ho kya school me or ya to fir teachers esa kahe hi na ki jitni marji baar puchlo. ab in didi ko hi lelo ye to video he jab tak net or phone me battery he rewind karke dekh loge but agar aapko ye didi face to face mile or tab aap inko 10 to 20 times hi puchloge na ya jab tak aapki samajh na aye tab tak puchoge to ye galiyaan dengi mn me or chanta lagayengi gaal pe tumhare sad reality of our class toppers and teachers,I
didi mujhe 1 baat batao last question me kya kiya he saraa mathematics ulat-palat kardiya. 20-12+4= 12 nikala but agar hm bina ye saree formulas ke dekhe to 20 teachers jisme se 12 maths padhate he jo already cleared he.or usme se 4 or nikaal diye jo dono subjects padhate he to kitne bache 4 na. to answer 8 hona chahiye kyunki 12 pehle hi alag he or 20-12=8 ye 20 teachers 24 kab hue jo 12 maths bhi padhate he or 12 physics bhi is hisaab se to 24 teachers dene chahiye na question me.clear my point of view if i am wrong without formula,D

"at 28:14 it should be r={(x,y):y=x-1;x,ya}not r={(x,y):y=x-1}",F
from 59:07 to 59:39 nowhere does she tell that x is real or integer or something else but after 59:39 she simply goes on to take x as integers. if nothing is mentioned about the nature of x one intuitively assumes it to be real number but never integer. this is a mathematical blunder!,F
55:37 ... where g(x)=0,F
at 42:36 you did not define the function and went on intuitively to explain with a particular function ( something like f(x)=x),F

"according to the tip ""add sugar to coffee"" you taught every value will be negative in 2nd quadrant except sin, similarly with 3rd quadrant except tan and similarly with 4th quadrant except cos. but in the book by ""amit m aggarwal for mca entrance pg no. 538"", it is written that sin (90 + x) and cosec (90 + x) are both positive, tan (180 + x) and cot(180 + x) are positive and similarly in fourth both cos and sec are positive. is the reciprocal of sine, cos, tan also suppose to be positive in the respective quadrants?",D

1:00:18 pi/2 + x or pi/2 -x may lie in any quadrant depending upon the value resulting from pi/2 + x or pi/2 - x. pi/2 + x and pi/2 - x may not always in 2nd and 1st quadrant respectively. pi/2 + x computation may take the angle to 3rd or 4th or even 1st quadrant; similarly pi/2 - x computation may take the angle to 2nd or 3rd or 4th quadrant respectively. why only 2nd or 1st quadrant is referred in this video? kindly clarify.,D
"w.r.t. 56:11 - as far as ""negative functions"" are concerned, sign of a trigonometric functions depends on the quadrant in which the angle i.e. theta falls. whether theta is a positive angle or negative angle, if theta falls in a quadrant where a trigonometric function is positive then that trigonometric function (-theta) and trigonometric function (+theta) would be positive only.",D

"i am really disappointed to see that you are teaching the domain of sinx as z ,that is, the set of all integers whereas it is ,as all know, the set of reals r which is quite obvious onx- axis. further the ""range ""you defined as the set of all admissible values of y for which x is defined but you forgot to say that x must be in the domain too because a lot of functions are there where one may observe that for some particular value /values of y ,x is defined but unfortunately x is not in the domain and so those values of y cannot be considered in the range.i request to kindly give correct information to the students so that they are not confused.thanks!",D

"i am watching your maths videos to teach my daughter who has appeared in std 10 in 2024. i am a 1998 batch commerce with maths cbse and i suppose u must be junior to me too . i have forgotten all concepts of class 11 and class 12 maths so i am watching your videos. and i must admit you are fantastic.the best thing about you is that you focus on pure concept and i truly praise you for your wonderful way of talking( i love it when you say ""bacchalog"" )and easy explanation of concepts.i just watched your video on complex numbers and it was too good. but you missed one concept and i feel you should add it in your video of complex numbers---root 2 root 3 = root 6 , for all real numbersbut ,root-1root -1 is not equal to root -1-1( why and how you can explain better than i can)also,i^2=-1 and (-i)^2=-1therefore ,the root -1=i or -i , but for complex numbers we take i only .madam i think these two concepts are missing but necessary for proper conceptual understanding. please also correct me if i am wrong.let me add again at the end that i am doing maths after almost 25 years and your videos i find the best for those who want conceptual understanding.you are doing a great job.thanks and regards,saurav.",F

"maam for q4 we can use and alternative method to solve as done by me , and we can get the same answer .the method i used was short as well as easy :1)write the same till you get a equation for (x-iy)(3+5i)= -6+24i2) solve the lhs equation and take the like terms all together we get : 3x+5y+ i(5x-3y) = -6 +24i3) use comparing the coefficients and form 2 equations as follows :eq 1 : 3x+5y = -6eq2 : 5x-3y=24now solving them simultaneously we get the values of x and y asx=3 , y= -3",F

thank you so much ma'am. you are a great teacher! keep up the great work,F
"ma'am, your explanation was very nice...but there is one doubt that i have always had...mathematically, we know that all these curves have specific conditions to follow which we call locus....so how do we know that when we obtain these curves by slicing cones in specific ways, these curves follow their required criteria....for example, we can say that we have obtained a parabola by slicing a cone in a certain way only if we prove that it is following the condition of parabola...i.e all points on the curve are equidistant from a fixed point called focus and a fixed line called directrix....so how do we prove that?this has always been my doubt...if we say we have obtained a parabola by slicing the cone in a certain way, then the question arises, what is it's focus, what is it's directrix...i would be very thankful if you could make a video answering this doubt...",D

mai continuity chapter dekh rhi thi mam ne kaha pehle limit and derivatives dekh kar aaoisliye aai hu,D
limit (x tends to zero)[(ax - x cosx ) /(b sin x) ]now divide numerator and denominator by bx= limit (x tends to zero)[{(a -cos x )/b}/(sinx)/x]=limit (x tends to zero) [(a-cos x) /b]/1= (a - cos 0)/b=(a- 1)/bcomment pleasevideo from 43 minutes onwards may see,F
nice and lucid lecture,F

why are derivatives so much better than limits?,D
thankyou ma'am,F
00:01 limits and derivatives are important concepts in calculus05:36 limits and derivatives17:14 limit of a function differs from its value at a point.22:11 limits and derivatives are discussed in this video.32:58 limits and derivatives are important concepts in mathematics.39:18 the video discusses limits and derivatives in mathematics.50:53 derivatives are calculated using the limits and first principles of derivatives.54:42 the product rule is used when a constant is multiplied by a function.1:05:01 the video discusses limits and derivatives in class 11 maths.1:10:19 dividing a number by 2 is equivalent to multiplying it by 1/2.,I

i m in 12th and just here to understanding the chapter ..............left only few hours for exam...,I
thank you so much ma'am i was so struggling to understand limits and derivatives but u made it easy to learn!!! best teacher ever.,F
"i have a suggestion. if you can start a new channel called ""learnohub shorts"" then you can post videos explaining topics from chapters. for example, you can upload you can upload a short video for ""iupac naming"" which explains only the topic itself. also it saves the students time by not going through the whole video for just one topic",F
at 18:00 thats not a function ...beacause in a f for one value of x no two value of y exists ...plz correct,D
"pro's : watching before 11th exam .legends: watching to clarify 12th topics at the starting .ultra legends like me: watching 2 days before boards exam to clarify 11th and study 12th.u have to feel for me .but i challenge u that i can still get 30+ and 35 as well .let's see if get them , i will mention it in replies",I

mam kindly increase the size of your pointer.,F
legends are watching this in 12th,I
thanks a lot of ma'am......u r great,F
most of the views are from 12th students who need this to understand continuity and differenciblity .,I
i am backbencher but my understanding is too much the reason behind this is roshani mam,F
mam hasnt covered all the concepts of limits,D
btw mam in 1stexample of trignometric funtions here we should have changed lim x tends 0 to ax tend 0 right....well anyway tysm for ur efforts..,F
thank you mam..!!,F
didi tusi great ho,I
thank you mam acahssei sab smjh agayaa honestly mam,F

how to b good at integralsstep1: limits n derivatives ( this video)step 2: continuity and differentiability ( learnohub oneshot 03:40:00)step 3: integrals( apni kaksha or unacademy),I
this is called as beauty with brain,F
"it's a clear warning to all my friends here. a test called bnat is coming as ads to lure you and get your phone number. the test has questions of class 11th, so a kid in class 7th will lose his mind and will lose tons of marks. if you happened to be of 10th, you can solve chemistry section. but, a mental ability section will make you lose rank. they will call a hundred times then and will get you down by telling manipulation, and false promises. the course is of no use and has no physical contact with the teacher like i any other coaching. they hand you books of other publication, and some videos of made around 2015 or 16. on youtube, they show some high end visual elements. but ground reality is something else. get some coaching like aakash, they are way better than these small players in this field. be careful.",I
