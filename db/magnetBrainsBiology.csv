"dear students, corona period was and is still till now a nightmare. particularly for students promoted to standard 11 from 10th.there is a significant level difference between science and particularly physics of 10th and 11th.apar from students continuous effort and study, it also requires a good tutioning. youtube videos do help, but for freshers and those who want to get deeper in concepts and numericals, these videos are less than enough.we are conducting physics classes for 11, 12, jee & neet by experienced faculty, who is an nitian and passionate towards teaching physics.you may reach out at 78799-30911 (whatsapp/call) for further guidance and info.wish you all get your academic glories back and shine again.best of luck dear students",I

200th comment,I
"i have a doubtif growth in in living organism in intrinsic then why we determine that our body has grown by looking at it 'externally' ?? like increase in height and width of the body. so how can we say growth in bodies in ""totally"" intrinsic? i mean it's true that without internal activities in our bodies our body will not be able to grow at an external level. so can we say that growth in living organism in both intrinsic and extrinsic?doubt 2 ( actually this is the cause of my first doubt)why we say that growth in non living is extrinsic? coz the growth is taking place at an internal level i.e increase in number of molecules and mass.",D

"no viruses can be permanently eradicated or eliminated from this earth by human beings as they're created by nature and released to the earth for punishing the humans for the sins committed by them so the viruses can be removed from the human body but not removed from the earth totally and they'll remain in the atmosphere and continue to infect the humans. the example is tuberculosis, malaria, polio which we thought were eradicated completely were again coming back so this proves once any virus comes on this earth never eliminate completely and keeps coming back to infect humans as the trace or elements of that viruses remain in atmosphere because it's nature's creation which can't be defeated by humans. we can temporarily eliminate them from our bodies but not from this earth just like the common cold which keeps coming back",D

mai ek bar amoeba ka diagram bana ke sir ko dikhaunga and contractile vacuoles nahi banaunga and sir agar bole ki contractile vacuole kaha hai to mai unse bolunga ki yah amoeba marine water me hai isliye contractile vacuole dissapear ho gya hai,D
protozoa itne chhote hote hai ki hum unhe apni ankho se nahi dekh sakte wah unicellular hote hai but unke ander bhi itne part hote hai let's imagine contractile vacuoles me pani bharta hai to uska matra kitna hota hoga water ke ek drop ko dekhna possible hai but ek micro organism ke ander uske part me contractile vacuoles hota hai usme kitna water hoga kalpna karna bahut rochak hai,D
mam hum log pani pite hai aur garmi ke wajah se wo hamare body se nikalta hai amino acid ke form me to kya hum use bhi excreation bol sakte hai ?,D

thank you so so so much maam,F
authentic explanation mam,F
"mam actually , nucleolus will make the rrna and then from rrna ribosomal subunits will form and then the formation of ribosomes completed. and we know that genetic material that is dna is present in nucleoplasm .. so mrna will be formed from dna and then the ribosomes which was formed earlier goes to the cytoplasm of in er and the amino acids which are lying freely in the cytoplasm get attached to ribosomes and mrna also get attached with the ribosomes and this will make the protein.so this is how the protein synthesis takes place.thank you!",D

nice mam,F
thank you ma'am,F
,I
"ma'am i have doubt in 1 line of ncert ma'am. ma'am if we add solute to water, water potential decreases that means more solute we add more solute potential is there know ma'am then why it's given more solute means lower psi s? how is it possible ma'am? please reply ma'am. so ma'am if question :2 chambers a with less solute and water and b with more solute and water and if they ask which solution has lower solute potential a or bans: a because less molecules present or. b because more solutes means less solute potential. pleasereply ma'am",D

thanks mam,F
madem antomocal dead space 150ml. air and residual volume air is a same thing because both the air remain after exhaling also..please answer,D
"does irv and erv include tv? like irv is 2500ml, does it include 500ml of tv(500ml tv and 2000ml extra air forced)? or is it total of 3000ml(500ml tv and 2500ml forced)?",D
mam agr koi aapka lecture headphone use krke or full sound me sunega toh uske ear rupture kr jaynge . too high sound,F
at the end of tidal vol u told that 500-150ml of air remains in bronchial tree..suppose 500 ml of air remained in this portion then no air reaches to the lungs at that time it means hypoxia can occur and the person can die...fully confused hlp me to clear the confusion...,D

completely wrong idea. haemophilia can also happen in females. but yes the chances are low. as beacuse they have two x chromosome. there are less chance that both of the chromosome will have defective gene. but it is possible. haemophilia is not related to y chromosome at all. it is all about x chromosome. that's why it is also called x linked disease.,F
after 3 years also this video is very helpful for us thank u magnet brain,F
you are great biology teacher in whole youtube,F

"sir i always having one question in mind when i study science whether it is physics, chemistry, biology, astrology, astronomy that we can understand the laws of nature through science that's ok like there is always is equal and opposite reaction to every action (a+b) =a2 +b2+2ab, angle of incident is equal to angle of reflection. but, if we just think deeply then question arises from where these laws came into this universe like we put laws when we write a computer program and accordingly it work so, is it not possible someone putted laws and facts in this universe which we are finding through science, technology and spirituality but can we find and know from where these laws came? think deeply and if anyone having answers please reply. thank you.",D
