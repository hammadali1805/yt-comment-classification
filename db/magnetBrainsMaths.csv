question 6 = onto function.,I
q.no6 is not onto because some y belongs to co domain has no pre imageeg. 7 has no pre image,D
question 6 into hai,I
"maths is really easy witg you mam , thank you so much",F
q-6 into,I
"since element \( 7 \) in \( b \) does not have a corresponding pre-image in \( a \), the function \( f \) is not onto",D
que 6 ) into,I
que 6) is into function because there exist some b(co-domain) for which there exist no a( domain),D
q6 is into function,I
2024 - 25 students attendance here,I
question no 6-into,I
6. into,I
thanks mam for that amazing sweet and lovelly sessionnice explanation mam,F
onto function,I
,I
you are geniusyou are geniusyou are genius ma'am,I
6 is into,I
into in question 6,I
mam question 6 into function,I
thankyou so much mam,F
question no. 6 is into,I
q6 is into,I
in q9 in cas1 for onto we'll take y belongs to n (co domain) not n belongs to n,D
question 6 is into,I
que 6 : it is into function,I
questions 6 into functions because there is major difference in one one or onto function ( one one function - different elements different images) but on the other hand ( into functions - there is some elements of codomain is the image of x not every element of codamin)since there is no pre image of 7 belong to codomain hence these function is into :-):-),D
q no 6 into because of 7 having no pre image,D
,I
thank you mam,F
question 6 is onto,I
thank u so much mam giving us a fantastic concept clearing video,F
q6... is into function,I
question no. 6 into ha,I
thank you so much mam..,F
q.6 : f is into,I
q6=into as well,I
in q6 the function is into,I
homework answer-:ans-6: into function,I
into function....,I
q6- is into,I
question no 6 - is into because there is no preimage for 7 .,D
q9 is many-one and into(as odd natural number are not included in the function) but the final answer is right that overall the function is not bijective. amazing videos though. was able to figure this out because of your concept overview videos.,D
one one nahi hai aur onto hai ma'am,D
question no 9 is wrong,D
,I
"as in q9 the function is not one-one but in the similar example 12 in ncert , why is the function given as one one?",D
que. 6 not onto but into,D
thank you mam.,F
mam this functions is not onto,D
"ques no. 6 , the function is into",I

thankyou so much mam for providing all the concepts your teaching way is very good,F
mam..10 number ka answer none of these kyu nehi hoga or transitive kyu hoga isse me kya logic he...,D
30:19 ma'am it is not transitive,D
mam question number 4 kya aap thoda explain kar skti hai pleasse,D
"33:42 yes mam it is transitive as we have (a,b) and there is no (b,_) so we say it is transitive",D
33:46 yes its reflexive transitive and symmetric,D
"24:03ans of que 6.you say this:- let the relation r in the set a = {x ez: 0 x 12}, given by r = {(a, b):la - bl is a multiple of 4}. then [2], the equivalence class containing 2, is:the relation r is defined as r = {(a, b): |a - b| is a multiple of 4}, and the set a is given as a = {x z: 0 x 12}.to find the equivalence class [2], we need to determine all the elements x in a such that (2, x) r. in other words, we need to find all x in a such that |2 - x| is a multiple of 4.let's calculate the differences between 2 and the elements in a and check if they are multiples of 4:|2 - 0| = 2, which is not a multiple of 4.|2 - 1| = 1, which is not a multiple of 4.|2 - 2| = 0, which is a multiple of 4.|2 - 3| = 1, which is not a multiple of 4.|2 - 4| = 2, which is not a multiple of 4.|2 - 5| = 3, which is not a multiple of 4.|2 - 6| = 4, which is a multiple of 4.|2 - 7| = 5, which is not a multiple of 4.|2 - 8| = 6, which is a multiple of 4.|2 - 9| = 7, which is not a multiple of 4.|2 - 10| = 8, which is a multiple of 4.|2 - 11| = 9, which is not a multiple of 4.|2 - 12| = 10, which is not a multiple of 4.based on the calculations, the elements in a that are related to 2 under the relation r are 2, 6, 8, and 10. therefore, the equivalence class [2] is {2, 6, 8, 10}.",D
"equivalence class of 2 {2,6,10}answer of 2nd questionyes, it is reflexive , symmetric and transitive ( equivalence)",D

thankuuu for explaining each question.....no one can explain a question like you....,F
"yes it is an equivalence relation because according to the questionif l is a line then it is absolute that it is parallel to itself .if l is parallel to m then m is also parallel to l , therefore it is also symmetric relation.if l is parallel to m and m is parallel to n then it is obvious that l is also parallel to n .therefore it is an equivalence relation",D

mam you are doing great work......,F
mama b kyu nehi hua (3.8) r,D
mam plz take the questions according to the new syllabus plzzs,F
"2:33:42 f:n-->r implies f's domain is natural no. only, but you have put 3/2 into f which is not correct as f is not defined for any x other than natural no., pls correct me if i am wrong.2:31:53 the inverse function should have the range of the original function as domain, but in this question, f inverse is not defined then.... as x cannot be 3/5 {as the domain of inverse function is r} @magnet brains",D
3:17:38 injective : - one -oneand surjective : - onto,D

mam thank you word is very very short for you. your video came to me like an angel,F
"no need to watch any one shot videos from different channels. just watch this one and relation and function will be 100% clear.me a person who watches one shot video just a day before exam, well definitely if you watch them seriously you will get 80% score but not more than that. in most of one shot videos they just tell basic/simple definition and question which you can solve on logical thinking on your own. so just go for this video. it's long but highly recommended!",F

mam thank u so much for this explanation...,F
critical point....critical point is that point where the point of local maxima and local minima found and if the function is differntiable so all the values of x where f'(x) =0 or if function is not differntiable so all the values of x for which the function is note differentiable or all the values of x for which f'(x) is not defined are the critical points....,D
thanks mam for amazing lecture,F

"dot product=0,thita=not defined",D
ha hota h,I
*thank you so much mam for providing this amazing video*,F
39:30 yes it is,D

mam i don't comment often but this time i have to do this....you're a great teacher...i just wish all my teachers could teach me the way u do...u clear those concepts about which no one talks...i love maths i scored 97 in 10th board in maths but in 12th i neglected this subject thinking that it's easy i'll do the practice later...and physics and chemistry are quite tough especially chem so i concentrated more on them....as the exam date got closer revision started in schl and i was shocked to see that i'am not able to do any questions from continuity and aod ...i was so tensed and was having hell lot of regret for taking this subject for granted...but mam when i found your channel i got some hope...i completed the lectures of first 4 chapters and when these two chapters 6 and7 came i thought may be i should watch one shot revision lectures or whole series first and then do your questions but when i did this i realised that this will take lots of time so i just gave a try and watched your mcq series ...earlier i used to just solve the questions and i did not needed explanation so i used to skip the explanation parts ...but when i saw them i was literally crying ...you explained every question so well that i did not wanted any one shot revison...love u maam....i don't know how to send emogis from laptop....thanku very much maam ..i'll pray to god for your happiness...take care:),F
